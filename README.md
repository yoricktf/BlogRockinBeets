This is a simple recipe website I made using MERN. The idea was to create something simple to use where I could store my recipes. 
To run the application yourself all you will need in the .env file are
- PORT
- ORIGIN
- TOKEN_SECRET
- MONGODB_URI
- CLOUDINARY_SECRET
- CLOUDINARY_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_KEY
